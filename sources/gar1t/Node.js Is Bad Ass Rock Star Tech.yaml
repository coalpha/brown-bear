   - beige: And in conclusion, we have found Apache to be an excellent server for our web applications.
   - beige: Any questions?
   - brown: Yes, I have a question.
   - brown: Why didn't you use Node.js?
   - brown: Node.js is an event-driven non-blocking I/O server that can be used to build high-performance web applications.
   - beige: That is an excellent question.
   - beige: We evaluated several alternative web servers and concluded that while options like Node.js are very interesting, Apache meets our needs and has a solid track record.
   - brown: But it doesn't have performance.
   - brown: Everybody knows that Apache applications are slow because they use blocking I/O and have context switches.
   - beige: That's a commonly held belief that threaded web servers are somehow less performant or scalable than event based servers.
   - beige: In fact, if you measure carefully, you will find that both models have similar performance characteristics.
   - brown: Threads don't scale.
   - brown: Simple as that.
   - beige: That may have been true ten years ago.
   - beige: It's not true today.
