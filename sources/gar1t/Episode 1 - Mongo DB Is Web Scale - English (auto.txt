but it doesn't scale everybody

knows that relational databases don't

scale because they use joints and right

to disk

scalability is a complicated topic and

it's hard to make a general statement

like that relational databases aren't

built for web scale MongoDB handles web

scale you turn it on in its scales right

up it may surprise you that there are a

handful of high-profile websites still

using relational databases and in

particular my sequel relational

databases have impotence mismatch I

think you mean impedance my sequel is

slow as a dog

MongoDB will run circles around my

sequel because MongoDB is web scale

MongoDB does have some impressive

benchmarks but they do some interesting

things to get those numbers for example

when your right to MongoDB you don't

actually write anything you staged your

data to be written at a later time if

there's a problem writing your data

you're

does that sound like a good design to

you if that's what they need to do to

get those kick-ass benchmarks then it's

a great design

if you are stupid enough to totally

ignore durability just to get benchmarks

I suggest you pipe your data to dev know

it will be very fast if dev Nell is fast

and web-scale I will use it is it

web-scale you are kidding me right I was

making a joke I mean if you're happy

writing to a database that doesn't give

you any idea that your data is actually

written just because you want high

performance numbers why not write to dev

no it's fast as hell does dev null

support shouting holy for my own

mental health I'm going to assume you're

just messing with me and err and

actually retarded do you even know what

a shard is shards are the secret

ingredient in the web-scale sauce they

just work please tell me you don't

actually make a living in a technology

field I'm a web programmer

as of this moment I officially resign

from my job as software engineer and

we'll take up work on a farm shoveling

pig ship in administering anal

suppositories to sick horses because

there will be a thousand times more

tolerable than being in the same

industry as dipshits like you you read

the latest post on high scalability calm

and think your Google architect

and paired slogans like web scale and

charting but you have no idea what the

 you were talking about you're going

to blow some project to hell because you

get a woody playing with software like

it's a sex doll relational databases

have been around since the 70s

and are some of the most mature

technology you can find yet somehow

everything needs to be reinvented

because Google and Amazon post some

white papers if you need to build a

globally distributed search engine that

manages petabytes of data fine build

your own database but if you like 99.9%

of companies you can probably get by

very well with something like my sequel

and maybe memcache Reedus will kick em

caches s it's so fast and scalable right

now I'm thinking of how much fun it will

be to castrate my first bull down on the

farm I cannot wait to cut off the

testicles of a 3,000 pound Raging Bull

as it tries to kick my head in MongoDB

is a document database that doesn't need

joins it uses MapReduce now I'm cleaning

a cistern of chicken shits but I don't

care because I don't have to listen to

the no SQL fat boy is reciting the

feature list of their favorite schema

free database by writing to memory map

files MongoDB can improve its write

throughput by a factor of 10

what the let's abandon transactions

consistency durability and thin our

mission-critical data to a table and

give it a night it will never forget I

mean who cares what we store as long as

we do it quickly oh sorry that's right

I'm on the farm now suffocating from the

stench of a thousand cow farts but it

smells like roses to me because I am

nowhere near this moronic conversation

MongoDB uses atomic modifiers for

contention free performance

now I've contracted more rjk coli from

cleaning cow stalls and I'm bleeding out

my asshole

I'll be dead soon but that is a welcome

relief I will never have to witness the

collapse of the world economy because no

SQL radicals talked financial

institutions into abandoning perfectly

good data stores because they didn't

support distributed MapReduce

MongoDB stores files of any size without

complicating your stack

thank you for your questions this

presentation is over and I'm off

to the farm to start my new career

you
