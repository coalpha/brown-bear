         And in conclusion, we have found Apache to be an excellent server for our web applications.
      </sentence>
      <sentence speaker="beige">
         Any questions?
      </sentence>
      <sentence speaker="brown">
         Yes, I have a question.
      </sentence>
      <sentence speaker="brown">
         Why didn't you use Node.js?
      </sentence>
      <sentence speaker="brown">
         Node.js is an event-driven non-blocking I/O server that can be used to build high-performance web applications.
      </sentence>
      <sentence speaker="beige">
         That is an excellent question.
      </sentence>
      <sentence speaker="beige">

      </sentence>
      <sentence speaker="beige">
         That's a commonly held belief that threaded web servers are somehow less performant or scalable than event based servers.
      </sentence>
      <sentence speaker="beige">
         In fact, if you measure carefully, you will find that both models have similar performance characteristics.
      </sentence>
      <sentence speaker="brown">
         Threads don't scale.
      </sentence>
      <sentence speaker="brown">
         Simple as that.
      </sentence>
      <sentence speaker="beige">
         That may have been true 10 years ago.
      </sentence>
      <sentence speaker="beige">
         It's not true today.
