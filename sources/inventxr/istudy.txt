The iStudy Platform is a mastery learning management system designed for students and teachers from all around the world. The world has evolved considerably and so has the internet. The idea of an online academic environment seems trivial these days since there are tons of learning management systems already well-established in the market. What makes iStudy different is not only its simplicity and usability. Four main characteristics differentiate iStudy from others: accessibility and flexibility, extreme personalization, clean and easy-to-use user interface, and the social aspect.
